### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project used Python to explore data related to available bike share data in New York City, Chicago, and Washington. The script uses pandas and numpy libraries to run descriptive statistics in an interactive format. In order to do this project successfully, you will need Python 3, NumPy, pandas, a text editor, and a terminal application.

### Project Details
This project prompts users for input filters such as location, month, and day of the week, and the project outputs descriptive statistics using their preferences. The project is also designed to display raw data as prompted, and it can be used over and over again to create new filters in the same session.

### Files used
*bikeshare.py
*chicago.csv
*new_york_city.csv
*washington.csv

### Credits
I used the pandas documentation page for general formatting/syntax and various github forum pages for general bug/error troubleshooting. I also used Udacity's available classroom resources.
