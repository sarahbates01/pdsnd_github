### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project used Python to explore data related to available bike share data in New York City, Chicago, and Washington. The script uses pandas and numpy libraries to run descriptive statistics in an interactive format. In order to do this project successfully, you will need Python 3, NumPy, pandas, a text editor, and a terminal application.

### Files used
*bikeshare.py
*chicago.csv
*new_york_city.csv
*washington.csv

### Credits
I used the pandas documentation page for general formatting/syntax and various github forum pages for general bug/error troubleshooting. I also used Udacity's available classroom resources.
